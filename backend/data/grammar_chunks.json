It is written for you to use without \na\u00a0teacher.\nThe book will be useful for you if you are not sure of the answers to questions like these:\nWhat is the difference between I did and I have done?\nWhen do we use will for the future?\nWhat is the structure after I wish?\nWhen do we say used to do and when do we say used to doing?\nWhen do we use the?\nWhat is the difference between like and as?\nThese and many other points of English grammar are explained in the book, and there are exercises \non each point.\nLevel\nThe book is intended mainly for intermediate students (students who have already studied the basic \ngrammar of English). It concentrates on those structures that intermediate students want to use, but \nthat often cause difficulty. Some advanced students who have problems with grammar will also find \nthe book useful.\nThe book is not suitable for elementary learners.\nHow the book is organised\nThere are 145 units in the book.  Each unit concentrates on a particular point of grammar.  Some \nproblems (for example, the present perfect or the use of the) are covered in more than one unit.  For a \nlist of units, see the Contents at the beginning of the book.\nEach unit consists of two facing pages.  On the left there are explanations and examples; on the right \nthere are exercises.  At the back of the book there is an Answer Key for you to check your answers to \nthe exercises (page 336).\nThere are also seven Appendices at the back of the book (pages 292\u2013301).  These include irregular \nverbs, summaries of verb forms, spelling, and American English.\nFinally, there is a detailed Index at the back of the book (page 373).\nHow to use the book\nThe units are not in order of difficulty, so it is not intended that you work through the book from \nbeginning to end.  Every learner has different problems, and you should use this book to help you \nwith the grammar that you find difficult.\nIt is suggested that you work in this way:\nUse the Contents and/or Index to find which unit deals with the point you are interested in.\nIf you are not sure which units you need to study, use the Study guide on page 326.\nStudy the explanations and examples on the left-hand page of the unit you have chosen.\nDo the exercises on the right-hand page.\nCheck your answers with the Key.\nIf your answers are not correct, study the left-hand page again to see what went wrong.\nYou can, of course, use the book simply as a reference book without doing the exercises.\nviii\nGroup \u201cT\u1ef1 h\u1ecdc TOEIC 990 c\u00f9ng Ms Hoa\u201d - C\u1ed9ng \u0111\u1ed3ng h\u1ecdc TOEIC ch\u1ea5t l\u01b0\u1ee3ng nh\u1ea5t VN \n\nTo the teacher\nEnglish Grammar in Use was written as a self-study grammar book, but teachers may also find it \nuseful as additional course material in cases where further work on grammar is necessary.\nThe book will probably be most useful at middle- and upper-intermediate levels (where all or \nnearly all of the material will be relevant), and can serve both as a basis for revision and as a means \nfor practising new structures.  It will also be useful for some more advanced students who have \nproblems with grammar and need a book for reference and practice.  The book is not intended to be \nused by elementary learners.\nThe units are organised in grammatical categories (Present and past, Articles and nouns, Prepositions \netc.).  They are not ordered according to level of difficulty, so the book should not be worked through \nfrom beginning to end.  It should be used selectively and flexibly in accordance with the grammar \nsyllabus being used and the difficulties students are having.\nThe book can be used for immediate consolidation or for later revision or remedial work.  It might \nbe used by the whole class or by individual students needing extra help.  The left-hand pages \n(explanations and examples) are written for the student to use individually, but they may of course \nbe used by the teacher as a source of ideas and information on which to base a lesson.  The student \nthen has the left-hand page as a record of what has been taught and can refer to it in the future.  \nThe exercises can be done individually, in class or as homework.  Alternatively (and additionally), \nindividual students can be directed to study certain units of the book by themselves if they have \nparticular difficulties not shared by other students in their class.  Don\u2019t forget the Additional exercises \nat the back of the book (see To the student).\nEnglish Grammar in Use Fifth Edition\nThis is a new edition of English Grammar in Use.  The differences between this edition and the fourth \nedition are:\n \n Much of the material has been revised or reorganised, and in most units there are changes in the \nexamples, explanations and exercises.\nThe book has been redesigned with new, updated illustrations.\n \n There is a new ebook available with all the contents of the book as well as audio, access to a \ndictionary and more.\nAn edition of English Grammar in Use without the Key is also available.  Some teachers may prefer \nto use this with their students.\nx\nGroup \u201cT\u1ef1 h\u1ecdc TOEIC 990 c\u00f9ng Ms Hoa\u201d - C\u1ed9ng \u0111\u1ed3ng h\u1ecdc TOEIC ch\u1ea5t l\u01b0\u1ee3ng nh\u1ea5t VN \n", "grammar_point": "ENGLISH", "keywords": ["adjective", "active", "verb", "countable", "present perfect", "preposition", "english", "present", "article", "future", "perfect", "past", "uncountable", "passive", "noun", "modal", "tense"], "examples": ["ing, it\u2019s worth -ing etc", "hand page of the unit you have chosen", "hand page", "hand page again to see what went wrong", "hand page as a record of what has been taught and can refer to it in the future"], "page_num": 0}, {"unit_num": "1", "title": "Sarah is in her car.

For example:\ninfinitive  \nclean  \nfinish  \nuse  \npaint  \nstop  \ncarry\npast simple \n\u23ab\n\u23ac\n\u23ad\npast participle  \ncleaned \nfinished \nused \npainted \nstopped \ncarried\nFor spelling rules, see Appendix 6.\nFor the past simple (I cleaned / they finished / she carried etc.), see Unit 5. \nWe use the past participle to make the perfect tenses and all the passive forms.\nPerfect tenses (have/has/had cleaned): \nI have cleaned the windows. (present perfect \u2013 see Units 7\u20138)\n They were still working.  They hadn\u2019t finished. (past perfect \u2013 see Unit 15)\nPassive (is cleaned / was cleaned etc.):\nHe was carried out of the room. (past simple passive)\nThis gate has just been painted. (present perfect passive)\n1.2  Irregular verbs\nWhen the past simple and past participle do not end in -ed (for example, I saw / I have seen), the verb \nis irregular. \nWith some irregular verbs, all three forms (infinitive, past simple and past participle) are the same.  \nFor\u00a0example, hit: \nDon\u2019t hit me. (infinitive) \nSomebody hit me as I came into the room. (past simple) \nI\u2019ve never hit anybody in my life. (past participle \u2013 present perfect) \nGeorge was hit on the head by a stone. (past participle \u2013 passive) \nWith other irregular verbs, the past simple is the same as the past participle (but different from the \ninfinitive).  For example, tell \u2192 told: \nCan you tell me what to do? (infinitive) \nShe told me to come back the next day. (past simple) \nHave you told anybody about your new job? (past participle \u2013 present perfect)\nI was told to come back the next day. (past participle \u2013 passive) \nWith other irregular verbs, all three forms are different.  For example, wake \u2192 woke/woken: \nI\u2019ll wake you up. (infinitive)\nI woke up in the middle of the night. (past simple)\nThe baby has woken up. (past participle \u2013 present perfect)\nI was woken up by a loud noise. (past participle \u2013 passive)\n1.3  The following verbs can be regular or irregular:\nburn   \u2192 burned \nor burnt\ndream  \u2192 dreamed or dreamt [dremt]*\nlean    \u2192 leaned \nor leant [lent]*\nlearn   \u2192 learned \nor learnt\nsmell \u2192  smelled or smelt\nspell  \u2192  spelled \nor spelt\nspill  \u2192  spilled \nor spilt\nspoil  \u2192  spoiled \nor spoilt\n* pronunciation\nsee Units 42\u201344\n\u23ab\n\u23ac\n\u23ad\n292\nSo you can say:\nI leant out of the window.    or    I leaned out of the window. \n The dinner has been spoiled.    or    The dinner has been spoilt. \nIn British English the irregular form (burnt/learnt etc.) is more usual.

The sentences in the guide are grouped together \n(Present and past, Articles and nouns etc.) in the same way as the units in the Contents (pages iii\u2013vi). \nEach sentence can be completed using one or more of the alternatives (A, B, C etc.).  There are between two and \nfive alternatives each time.  IN SOME SENTENCES MORE THAN ONE ALTERNATIVE IS POSSIBLE. \nIf you don\u2019t know or if you are not sure which alternatives are correct, then you probably need to study the \nunit(s) in the list on the right.  You will also find the correct sentence in this unit. (If two or three units are listed, \nyou will find the correct sentence in the first one.) \nThere is a key to this study guide on page 372. \nPresent and past\n1.1 \nAt first I didn\u2019t like my job, but \n to enjoy it now.\nA I\u2019m starting    B I start\n1.2 \nI don\u2019t understand this sentence.
